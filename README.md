<h1>VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY SCHEME</h1>

<h2>summary</h2>
<p>
Visual cryptography is one of the techniques used to encrypt the
images by dividing the original image into transparencies. The
transparencies can be sent to the intended person, and at the
other end the transparencies received person can decrypt the
transparencies using the tool, thus gets the original image. The
proposed Visual cryptography provides the demonstration to the
users to show how encryption and decryption can be done to the
images. In this technology, the end user identifies an image,
which is not the correct image. That is, while transmitting the
image the sender will encrypt the image using the application
here sender gets the two or more transparencies of the same
image. The application provides an option to the end user of
encryption. The end user can divide the original image into
number of different images. Using the application we can send
encrypted images that are in the format of GIF and PNG. The
encrypted transparencies can be saved in the machine and can be
sent to the intended person by other means.
